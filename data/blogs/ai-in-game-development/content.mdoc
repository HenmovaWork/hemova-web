### 🧩 6. **Game Design & Balancing Insights**

AI can simulate thousands of game loops and help balance gameplay by analyzing what’s too easy, too hard, or too boring.

> **Example:** AI playtests your game 500 times to test level completion time, damage balance, and enemy placement.

🔧 **Tools:**

- Ludo.ai
- Custom reinforcement learning models
- Unity ML Agents Toolkit
