### 📱 **Mobile Game Development: A Goldmine with Volume**

#### ✅ **Pros:**

- **Massive audience:** Over 3 billion active mobile gamers globally.
- **Low entry barrier:** Anyone with Unity or Godot can publish on Play Store/App Store.

- **Faster development cycles:** Casual/hypercasual games can be made in weeks.

#### 💸 **Monetization Examples:**

- **Rewarded ads**: 1–5 cents per view. A game with 100k daily active users can earn thousands per month.
- **IAP**: Freemium models still dominate mobile revenue.

#### ⚠️ Challenges:

- Discoverability is tough without marketing.
- Monetization heavily relies on ads or whales.
- App store policies and frequent updates can be frustrating.
